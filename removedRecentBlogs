						<a href="#">HOME HEALTH VS IN-HOME CARE</a>
					</h4>
					<p style="text-align:justify">
						In short, home health is an extension of medical care and private care is additional in-home support for people
						who have difficulty performing everyday tasks.

						Home health is usually for an allotted period of time and takes the form of rehabilitation similar to what one
						might experience in a skilled nursing or outpatient rehab facility. This must be ordered by a doctor and is
						typically covered (at least in part) through medical insurance.

						<a href="#">PHYSICAL HEALTH FOR AN ACTIVE ADULT LIFE</a>
					</h4>
					<p style="text-align: justify">
						One of the biggest concerns for seniors is depression. Between a dwindling social network, waning health, and
						financial concerns, it’s no wonder that depression affects up to 13.5 percent of the 65 and up crowd in the
						United States. Contrary to popular belief, depression is not a normal part of aging. If you notice yourself
						losing interest in things you normally enjoy, are more fatigued than usual, or see a significant pattern
						fluctuation in your eating and sleeping habits, it’s time to pay attention to your mental health. Fortunately, as
						Qunomedical points out, depression is a treatable condition and one you don’t have to live with.
